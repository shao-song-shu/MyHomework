1. Read in the data base of phoneme pairs from Wedel, Kaplan, and Jackson (2013).  The relative path from the working directory of this project is: "scottdata/CognitionPaperModifiedData.csv"

```{r}

Phonemes <- read.csv("/Users/Ian/Documents/R_Class/r_programming_bsos/scottdata/CognitionPaperModifiedData.csv")
Phonemes

```

2. Read in the data using the WRONG function.  What does it look like?

```{r}

Phonemes <- read.delim("/Users/Ian/Documents/R_Class/r_programming_bsos/scottdata/CognitionPaperModifiedData.csv")
Phonemes

# The values are not separated into columns.

```

3. Change some (or all) of the column names.  Provide a table that links original column names with the current/new column names.

```{r}

head(Phonemes)
OldNames <- colnames(Phonemes)
OldNames
NewNames <- c("Corpus", "System", "Pair", "Contextual", "Features", "Merged", "AllMinimalPairs", "BetweenMinimalPairs", "WithinMinimalPairs", "AllEntropy", "WithinEntropy", "SegmentalEntropy", "BiphoneEntropy", "HighSegmentalToken", "LowSegmentalToken", "HighSegmentalType", "LowSegmentalType")
NewNames
colnames(Phonemes) <- NewNames
head(Phonemes)
data.frame(OldNames, NewNames)

```

4. Locate NAs.  Remove all rows containing NAs.

```{r}

summary(Phonemes)
Phonemes.NoNA <- Phonemes[!is.na(Phonemes$AllMinimalPairs), ]
summary(Phonemes.NoNA)

```

5. Recode the "Corpus" variable in the following way:
Am = American
Du = Dutch
Fr = French
Ge = German
HK = Cantonese
Ko = Korean
RP = British
Sl = Slovakian
Sp = Spanish

```{r}

levels(Phonemes$Corpus)
levels(Phonemes$Corpus) <- c("American", "Dutch", "French", "German", "Cantonese", "Korean", "British", "Slovakian", "Spanish")
levels(Phonemes$Corpus)

```


6. Run a logistic regression, using `glm()`, where "Merged" status is the (binary) dependent variable, and "WithinMinPairs" is the predictor.
  - Hint #1: the basic usage of `glm()` is:
```{r eval=FALSE}
results <- glm(DV ~ predictor1 + predictor2 + ...  , 
               data = dataframe.object,
               family = "binomial")
```
  - Hint #2: you need the DV to be 0s and 1s, not a factor.
  
7. Use `summary()` to display the results.

8. Using INLINE code, report the estimate, standard error, and p-value for the WithinMinPairs coefficient.  This will look something like:

The estimate for the WithinMinPairs coefficient was `r `, with a standard error of `r ` and a p of `r `.

EXTRA CREDIT: figure out how to display the above results with only a few decimal places

HINT: use `str()` to figure out how to extract these values.
